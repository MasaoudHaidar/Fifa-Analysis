The credit for the increase is being assigned to the club in the earlier year.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the graphs above we observe:\n",
    "1. Players of higher ages tend to show less changes in all the metrics. Infact playersa above the age between 30 and 35 tend to show lesser changes in the skill area improvements. \n",

    "1. Age definitely plays a role in the calculation of the score changes and hence we are going to calculate the average on every age.\n",

Once the model is trained predict the overall score improvements anticipated from the other factors for the club. If the overall predicted score is greater then give the team a positive score else give the team a negative score. Normalize the scores on a scale of 100.
